# compilerdesign
A complete compiler for a made up coding language

To run the project, run the Parser.java file. It will ask for a input text file. These files can be found in the project folder. 
They contain the "code" written in the made up coding language. The files will be analyzed, parsed for syntax and grammar, and then run, if there are no errors. If there are errors, the program will not exexute and will output the error type and location.
